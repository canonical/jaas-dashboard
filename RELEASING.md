# Releasing Juju Dashboard

To release the dashboard, first follow the [QA steps](#qa-steps), then you will
need to do a [dashboard GitHub release](#release-the-dashboard) then [release both
charms](#release-charms) and also [release to jaas.ai](#release-to-jaasai).

## QA

### Deployments

Juju dashboard can be deployed in a number of different scenarios. Each one needs
to be QAed to ensure a successful release.

#### JAAS

To QA the dashboard in JAAS, first get a copy of jaas.ai:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:canonical/jaas.ai.git
cd jaas.ai
```

Update the dashboard to the latest release with:

```shell
yarn install
yarn pull-jaas-dashboard
```

Install [Dotrun](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun) if you don't have it
already and run:

```shell
dotrun
```

Then visit `http://0.0.0.0:8029` or `http://<multipass.ip>:8029`.

Now click 'Your models' in the header and log in. You should now be able to
continue with the [QA steps](#qa-steps).

This might also be a good time to deploy models to AWS, GCE and Azure clouds to
confirm these work with the dashboard.

#### Local machine controller

If you don't already have a local controller you will need [to set one up](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard/tree/main/HACKING.md#juju-controllers-in-multipass).

Clone the [juju-dashboard-charm
repo](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm).

```shell
git clone git@github.com:canonical/juju-dashboard-charm.git
cd juju-dashboard-charm
```

Update the dashboard to the latest release:

```shell
./scripts/update-machine-charm-dashboard.sh
```

Then follow the instructions to [build and
deploy](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#building-and-testing-the-machine-charm)
the machine charm and finally, follow the [QA steps](#qa-steps).

#### Local k8s controller

To QA the dashboard in Kubernetes you will need a local k8s environment. This
can be quite tricky, but is possible even inside a Multipass container. We have
[a separate
guide](/docs/multipass-microk8s.md) for how you can set this up.

Once you have K8s running then shell or ssh into the Multipass container that is
running K8s and continue with these instructions.

Clone the [juju-dashboard-charm
repo](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm).

```shell
git clone git@github.com:canonical/juju-dashboard-charm.git
cd juju-dashboard-charm
```

Then follow the instructions to [build and
deploy](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#building-and-testing-the-k8s-charm)
the Kubernetes charm and finally, follow the [QA steps](#qa-steps).

### QA steps

The following QA steps should be preformed in each of the
[deployments](#deployments) before doing a dashboard release.

- [ ] Check that you can log in and out both using a username/password as well
      as through an external provider.
- [ ] Check that the controllers list displays the available controller(s).
- [ ] Check that your models appear in the model list.
- [ ] Check that you can add an external controller and that it appears in the
      controllers list and that the models for the external controller appear in the
      model list.
- [ ] Check that you can search and filter models.
- [ ] Check that you can modify model access.
- [ ] Check that you can only see the models you have access to.
- [ ] Check that you can view a model details page.
- [ ] Check that you can search applications and perform multiple actions on
      multiple apps.
- [ ] Check that you can configure an application.
- [ ] Check that you can perform actions on units.
- [ ] Check that you can view the action logs for a model.
- [ ] Check that the dashboard works at various screen sizes, including mobile.
- [ ] Check that the dashboard works across browsers.

## Release the dashboard

The first step before releasing the dashboard is to follow the [QA
instructions](#qa). This is a good time to do a really thorough QA and pause and fix any issues you
find so that you don't have to restart the release process.

Next, update the dashboard with the next version, following the
[SemVer](https://semver.org/) rules.

```
yarn version [major|minor|patch]
```

Create a PR and land the version update.

Now get a fresh copy of the dashboard:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:canonical/juju-dashboard.git
cd juju-dashboard
```

Install the dependencies and build the dashboard package:

```shell
yarn install
yarn generate-release-tarball
```

Now create a [new release on
GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard/releases/new) with the
following details:

You should create a new tag for the release using the same version that was
set in your package.json.

Set the title to the same version number.

Attach the release tarball that you created earlier.

Get the changes since the last release. You can get the changes using GitHub at `https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard/compare/<last-version-number>...main`
or run the following command inside the repo:

```shell
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD  --oneline
```

Create the release notes using the following template:

```markdown
## New features:

-

## Improvements:

-

## Bug fixes:

-
```

Finally, publish the release.

## Release charms

Juju Dashboard can be deployed using a machine charm or a Kubernetes charm which both
need updating and releasing.

### Machine charm

Fork and clone the [juju-dashboard-charm
repo](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm).

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/juju-dashboard-charm.git
cd juju-dashboard-charm
```

Update the dashboard to the latest release:

```shell
./scripts/update-machine-charm-dashboard.sh
```

[Build and
deploy](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#building-and-testing-the-machine-charm)
the machine charm and follow the [QA steps](#qa-steps) to confirm it is working.

Now create a PR to land the update dashboard package.

Next follow the [release
steps](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#machine-charm) to
publish the charm to the edge channel.

[Deploy the edge machine charm](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard#deploy) in a
controller and [check that the dashboard works](#qa-steps).

Finally, follow the [release
steps](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#machine-charm) again to
publish the charm to either the beta or stable channel depending on whether this
release is ready for general use.

https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#building-and-testing-the-k8s-charm

### Kubernetes charm

Fork and clone the [juju-dashboard-charm
repo](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm).

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/juju-dashboard-charm.git
cd juju-dashboard-charm
```

[Build and
deploy](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#building-and-testing-the-k8s-charm)
the Kubernetes charm and follow the [QA steps](#qa-steps) to confirm it is working.

The K8s charm does not need to commit any changes to the repo as a
Docker image is published to Charmhub instead.

Next follow the [release
steps](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#k8s-charm) to
upload the docker resource and publish the charm to the edge channel (you can
skip the checkout and docker build steps if you've just completed them in the
previous step).

[Deploy the edge K8s charm](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard#deploy) in a
controller inside Kubernetes and [check that the dashboard works](#qa-steps).

Finally, follow the [release
steps](https://github.com/canonical/juju-dashboard-charm#k8s-charm) again
(skipping the image upload as you can use the previously uploaded resource) to
publish the charm to either the beta or stable channel depending on whether this
release is ready for general use.

## Release to jaas.ai

To release to [JAAS](https://jaas.ai) you will need to first do a [dashboard
release](#release-the-dashboard) (if not yet released).

Next get a copy of jaas.ai:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/jaas.ai.git
cd jaas.ai
```

Now you can update the dashboard with:

```shell
yarn install
yarn pull-jaas-dashboard
```

At this point it would be good to QA that the dashboard is working locally. For
this you will need to install [Dotrun](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun),
then run jaas.ai with:

```shell
dotrun
```

Then visit `http://0.0.0.0:8029` or `http://<multipass.ip>:8029`.

Now click 'Your models' in the header and log in. You should see the latest
version of the dashboard.

Follow the [QA steps](#qa-steps) to confirm that the dashboard is working as
expected.

Once you're satisfied that everything is working then create and land a PR.

Next, trigger the [staging CI job](https://jenkins.canonical.com/webteam/job/jaas.ai/).

Visit the URL that gets displayed at the end of the staging run and again follow
the [QA steps](#qa-steps) to confirm that the dashboard is working.

Now trigger the [production CI
job](https://jenkins.canonical.com/webteam/job/jaas.ai-production/) which will
do the release to jaas.ai.

Do a final [QA](#qa-steps) of the released dashboard on https://jaas.ai to confirm that it was released
correctly and then you're all done!
